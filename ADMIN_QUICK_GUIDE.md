UPDATE legacy_spa_points 
SET claimed = false, claimed_by = null, claimed_at = null
WHERE full_name = 'PLAYER_NAME';
```

#### Check User SPA Balance
```sql
-- See user's current SPA points
SELECT p.display_name, pr.spa_points 
FROM profiles p
JOIN player_rankings pr ON p.user_id = pr.player_id
WHERE p.email = 'user@email.com';
```

#### Daily Report Query
```sql
-- Daily claim report
SELECT 
  DATE(claimed_at) as claim_date,
  COUNT(*) as claims_today,
  SUM(spa_points) as total_spa_claimed
FROM legacy_spa_points 
WHERE claimed = true 
GROUP BY DATE(claimed_at)
ORDER BY claim_date DESC;
```

### 5. Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check database connection
# Refresh admin page
# Verify user exists in profiles table
```

#### Issue: Duplicate claims
```sql
-- Find potential duplicates
SELECT claimed_by, COUNT(*) 
FROM legacy_spa_points 
WHERE claimed = true 
GROUP BY claimed_by 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

#### Issue: Missing legacy data
```bash
# Re-run migration
cd /workspaces/sabo-pool-v12
./auto-apply-migrations.sh

# Verify data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM legacy_spa_points; -- Should be 45
```
