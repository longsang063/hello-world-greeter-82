## ⚠️ REMAINING OPTIMIZATIONS

### High Priority:
1. **admin-misc chunk**: 355KB → Need further splitting
2. **tournaments chunk**: 336KB → Implement lazy routes
3. **challenges chunk**: 150KB → Component-level splitting

### Medium Priority:
1. Component-level lazy loading
2. Route preloading on hover
3. Service worker caching
4. Image optimization

### Low Priority:
1. Bundle analyzer automation
2. Performance monitoring
3. A/B testing configurations
4. Advanced tree shaking

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Next 1-2 days):
```bash
# Further split admin-misc chunk
npm run build:analyze  # Analyze what's in admin-misc
```

### Short-term (Next week):
1. Implement route-level lazy loading
2. Add component lazy loading
3. Setup performance monitoring

### Long-term (Next month):
1. Service worker optimization
2. Advanced caching strategies
3. Performance budgets
4. Automated optimization testing
