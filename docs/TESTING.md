# ðŸ§ª Testing Guide

## Overview
Comprehensive testing strategy for SABO Pool Arena application.

## Testing Structure

### Test Types
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Component interaction testing
3. **E2E Tests** - Full user workflow testing
4. **Performance Tests** - Load and speed testing

## Running Tests

### Development Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Lighthouse performance audit
npm run lighthouse

# Bundle size analysis
npm run analyze

# Performance monitoring
npm run perf:monitor
```

## Test Coverage

### Critical Test Areas
- âœ… User Authentication (login/register/logout)
- âœ… Tournament Creation & Management
- âœ… Challenge System (create/accept/complete)
- âœ… Payment Integration (VNPAY)
- âœ… Admin Panel Functionality
- âœ… Real-time Features (notifications/updates)
- âœ… Mobile Responsiveness
- âœ… Data Validation & Security

### Test Scenarios

#### Authentication Flow
```javascript
describe('Authentication', () => {
  test('User can register successfully')
  test('User can login with valid credentials')
  test('User cannot login with invalid credentials')
  test('User can logout successfully')
  test('Protected routes require authentication')
})
```

#### Tournament Management
```javascript
describe('Tournaments', () => {
  test('User can create tournament')
  test('User can join tournament')
  test('Tournament brackets generate correctly')
  test('Tournament results are recorded')
  test('Admin can manage tournaments')
})
```

#### Payment Integration
```javascript
describe('Payment', () => {
  test('VNPAY integration works correctly')
  test('Payment verification succeeds')
  test('Failed payments are handled gracefully')
  test('Refund process works correctly')
})
```

## Automated Testing

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npm run test:e2e
```

### Quality Gates
- âœ… Test coverage > 80%
- âœ… All critical paths tested
- âœ… No failing tests
- âœ… Performance benchmarks met

## Manual Testing Checklist
